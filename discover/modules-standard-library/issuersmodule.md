## When to use this module?

An Issuer might want to restrict the use of his portal to only Issuers. In other words, his portal will only be able to
attest Issuers as subjects (attestees) of the future attestations.

Once this module is set for a portal, any attestation request going through the portal will need to be destined to an
Issuer as subject.

The list of Issuers changes over time, but is not controlled by this module. It is managed at the `PortalRegistry`
level.

## When not to use this module?

This Module probably serves its purpose in only a few cases, so make sure your use case really requires to only
attestations to Issuers.

## How to use this module?

This Module doesn't require any preliminary setup, you just need to pass its address registering your Portal.

## How to check the list of Issuers?

### Via the Explorer

The Issuers are listed on the [landing page of the Explorer](https://explorer.ver.ax)

### Via the SDK

Pending issue [#506](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-attestation-registry/issues/506) resolution.
