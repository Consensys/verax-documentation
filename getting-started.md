# ⚒ Getting Started

If you're a dApp, and you want to publish attestations, here are the steps to get up and running:

1. Decide on your [_**schema**_](core-concepts/schemas.md), which is a description of what your attestations will look
   like.
2. Deploy your [_**portal**_](core-concepts/portals.md), which is a contract through which you push attestations into
   the registry\
   (note: you can also call a smart contract function to do this for you — simple!).
3. Send your [_**attestations**_](core-concepts/attestations.md) to your portal contract, which will push them to the
   registry.
4. All done! :coffee:

***

You can call a function on the registry to deploy a portal contract for you, or you can deploy your own portal
contract, over which you have full control to customize the way you wish.

You can decide to keep your portal simple, and you can also use one or more [_**modules**_](core-concepts/modules.md),
which are small smart contracts that run extra verification logic over the attestations before they are registered.
We have some [examples modules in our GitHub repo](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-attestation-registry/tree/dev/contracts/src)
that you can use, and more are being added all the time.

_**Note:**_ the Verax registry is currently permissioned, so you'll need to get on the allowlist to register
schemas or portals. Fortunately this is fairly easy, [reach out to us](get-involved/get-in-touch.md)! :smile:
