# âš’ Getting Started

If you're a dapp and you wnt to publish attestations, here are the steps to get up and running:

1. Decide on your [_**schema**_](core-concepts/schemas.md), which is a description of what your attestations will look like.
2. Deploy your [_**portal**_](core-concepts/portals.md), which is a contract through which you push attestations into the registry\
   (note: you can also just call a smart contract function to do this for you - simple!).
3. Send your [_**attestations**_](core-concepts/attestations.md) to your portal contract, which will push them to the registry.
4. All done! :coffee:

***

While you can just call a function on the registry to deploy a portal contract fo you to use, can also depoy your own contract, over which you have full control to customize however you wish.

You can also decide to keep your portal simple, but one or more [_**modules**_](core-concepts/modules.md), which are small smart contracts that run extra verification logic over the attestations before they are registered.  There are some [examples modules in our GitHub repo](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-attestation-registry/tree/dev/contracts/src/example) you use, and more are being added all the time.

_**Note:**_ the Verax registry is currently permissioned, so you'll need to get on the allowlist in order to reggsitry schemas or portals.  Fortunately this is very easy, just reach out on Discord! :smile:
