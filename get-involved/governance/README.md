# Governance

The verax community is establishing formal protocol governance that seeks to help coordinate the various teams that are
contributing to Verax, as well giving a voice to stakeholders that have integrated with Verax, or are otherwise
dependent on it by consuming it's data.\
\
The main principles of the protocol goverance that we have established are transparency, inclusivity and fairness. As
the protocol matures and the community grows, governance will necessary need to evolve, and we welcome contributions in
the form of research, insights, ideas and feedback.\
\
The following pages describe in more detail the governance system that is currently in place and how the various
participants and processes in the governance system.
