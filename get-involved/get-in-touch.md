### Office Hours

If you'd prefer an in-person chat, you're more than welcome to drop into our [bi-weekly office hours call](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y181ZTNhMDlmNDI2ZDQ3Y2JkNTFhNzY0ZmIwNmJmZGQ2ZjUwYjllNTllYjEyNGIxZTBjYmViMzdkYzI1OWU3NTg0QGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20). This is an informal, unstructured open conversation that anybody can join to ask questions or generally chat about Verax and on-chain attestations.

### Mailing List
