# Contribute to Governance

{% hint style="info" %}
Governance is something that is crucially important to not get wrong.  So although we are currently exploring different governance mechanisms and how to make governance inclusive, fair and transparent, the conversation is ongoing.\

We welcome ideas and suggestions, so please get in touch if you'd like to be involved!

## Overview of Governance

If on-chain attestation registries see the level of adoption that we think they will, then a number of dapps will be using them to store public data.  This will make shared public registries an important  part of a network's infrastructure.  For this reason, governance is something that we need to get right.  Any governance mechanism that we adopt will need to meet three crucial requirements:

* **Transparency** - decisions should be made in the open and the rationale for the decisions should be clearly and widely understood.
* **Inclusivity** - governance should be open to everyone to have their say, and people should not be locked out from partcipating.
* **Fairness** - the governance mechanism should not be dominated by large, influential actors and should recognize the interests of minority stakeholders, and at the same time the governance mechanism should recognise the relative level of contribution made by stakeholders.

## Directions of Exploration

One current direction of exploration is to adopt a democratic process known as RadicalxChange (RxC) Voice. The basic components are:

**Voice Credit Delegation:** Each participant would receive voice credits, which they could either keep or delegate to others, effectively distributing decision-making power.

**Deliberation:** A stage for open discussion where everyone contributes ideas regarding strategic priorities.

**Quadratic Voting:** Participants would use their remaining voice credits to vote on the various options surfaced during the deliberation stage. The benefit of Quadratic Voting is it takes into account both majority and minority opinions, resulting in more balanced outcomes. More information about Quadratic Voting can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic\_voting). The RxC Voice process is open-source and free to use, aligning with our values of transparency and inclusivity. You can also explore the [RxC Voice app](https://voice.radicalxchange.org/).
