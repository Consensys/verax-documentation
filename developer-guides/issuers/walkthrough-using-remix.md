We are currently developing an [SDK](../using-the-sdk.md), which will make it much easier and faster to get up and running, but for the time being you can watch this video walkthrough which takes you through how to interact with Verax on the Linea testnet, and how you can create a schema, a module, a portal that uses that module, and finally how to create an attestation.
