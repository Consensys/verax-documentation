# Issuers

The pages in this section contain all the relevant information that need in order to get set up as an issuer and start issuing attestations directly into the Verax attestation Registry.

We are currently developing an SDK, which will make it much easier and faster to get up and running, but for the time being you can watch this video walkthrough which takes you through how to interact with Verax on the Linea testnet, and how you can create a schema, a module, a portal that uses that module, and finally how to create an attestation.
