# Revoke an Attestation

Revoking an attestation is straightforward. The revoke an attestation was previously created in the registry, you need to call the `revoke` function on the portal that first issued the attestation. The `revoke` method is:

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Revokes the attestation for the given identifier and can replace it by a new one
 * @param attestationId the attestation ID to revoke
 * @param replacedBy the replacing attestation ID (leave to just revoke)
 */
function revoke(bytes32 attestationId, bytes32 replacedBy) external virtual {
  _onRevoke(attestationId, replacedBy);
  attestationRegistry.revoke(attestationId, replacedBy);
}
```

The attestation registry will check that the portal actually allows revocations, as defined when the portal was first
registered. If a portal was registered with the `revocable` property set to `false` then it will reject any attempt to
revoke an existing attestations.

The other property to be aware of is the `replacedBy` property, which should be set to the ID of some attestation that
is meant to replace the one being revoked. If you wish to revoke an attestation without actually replacing it with
another one, you can set this to `bytes32(0)`.

Note that the `replacedBy` flag, the `revocationDate` and the `replacedBy` field are all stored on-chain in the
attestation's metadata so that they are easily legible to anyone who is looking up an attestation directly from the
smart contract.

## Lifecycle Hooks

You can also place custom logic in the `_onRevoke` lifecycle hook to run any additional verification before the
revocation takes place, or perform any other action that you wish.

## Verification Checks

Note that you can't revoke an attestation made by another portal, even if that portal allows revocation. The full list
of verification checks that the attestation registry makes before revocation an attestation are as follows:

* Checks that the attestation being revoked exists (is registered).
* Checks that it is not already revoked.
* Checks that the Portal revoking the attestation initially created it.
* Checks if the address that first created the attestation through the portal is the same one revoking it.
* Checks that the portal through which the attestation was issued actually allows revocations.

Once all these verification checks have passed, the attestation can be created in the registry.
