# â™’ For Attestation Issuers

The pages in this section contain all the relevant information that is needed in order to get set up as an issuer and
start
issuing attestations directly into the Verax attestation Registry.

The overall steps for getting up and running include the following:

1. [Design and register a schema](create-a-schema.md)
2. [Optionally create one or more modules](create-a-module.md)
3. [Deploy your portal contract](create-a-portal.md)
4. [Start creating your attestations!](create-an-attestation.md)

There is also a video walkthrough you can look at, which takes you through going from zero, to getting set up and
issuing an attestation in 20 minutes using only Remix.
