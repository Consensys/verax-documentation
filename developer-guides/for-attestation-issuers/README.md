# â™’ For Attestation Issuers

The pages in this section contain all the relevant information needed to get set up as an issuer and start issuing attestations directly into the Verax Attestation Registry.

The overall steps for getting up and running include the following:

1. [Create and register a Schema](create-a-schema.md)
2. [Optionally create one or more Module(s)](create-a-module.md)
3. [Optionally register one or more Module(s)](create-a-module-1.md)
4. [Create a Portal contract](create-a-portal.md)
5. [Register a Portal contract](create-a-portal-1.md)
6. [Start creating your attestations](create-an-attestation.md)

All these steps can be done in three different ways:

* manually calling the smart contracts
* using a blockchain explorer such as [Lineascan](https://lineascan.build/)
* using the official Verax SDK

We will go over the three ways in the following sections.
