# Encoding Attestation Data

Attestation data is encoded according to the schema the attestation is associated with. The schema is parsed by the client reading the attestation, in a way that results in a series of data types that can be used to `abi.decode` the attestation data. In order for this to happen, the attestation data must first be encoded using `abi.encode`.

We are currently developing an SDK which will make it much easier to encode a JSON object into attestation data.  Until the SDK is completed you can use the following approach:

## Modelling a Schema as a Solidity Struct

The easiest way to think of a schema is like a Solidity struct. Take for example a very simple schema:

`string username, string teamname, uint16 points, bool active`

This can be thought of as a struct:

```solidity
struct Profile {
    string username;
    string teamname;
    uint16 points;
    bool active;
}
```

If we were to encode an attestation that references this schema, we could do it client side using the ethers library (or equivalent):

```javascript
const encodedStruct = ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
  ['string', 'string', 'uint16', 'bool'],
  ['bojo','torries', 3, false]
);
```

This can later be decoded by some off-chain client, with the subgraph, or by another on-chain contract using Solidity:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract StructDecodingExample {
    struct Profile {
        string username;
        string teamname;
        uint16 points;
        bool active;
    }

    function receiveEncodedStruct(
        bytes memory encodedStruct
    ) public pure returns (gamer memory) {
        Profile memory gamer;

        // Decode the struct using abi.decode
        (gamer.username, gamer.teamname, gamer.points, gamer.active) = abi.decode(encodedStruct, (string, string, uint16, bool));

        return gamer;
    }
}

```

## Encoding Nested Data

Sometimes a schema is a bit more complicated, in that it contains more than just a flat data structure, and may contain nested data structure like so:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
string username, string teamname, uint16 points, bool active, ( string gametype, string gamemode ) preferences
```
{% endcode %}

Which can be thought of as this sort of nested struct:

```solidity
struct Preferences {
    string gametype;
    string gamemode;
}

struct Profile {
    string username;
    string teamname;
    uint16 points;
    bool active;
    Preferences setup;
}
```

Again, encoding the attestation for this sort of schema using a client side library such as ethers would look like this:

```javascript
const encodedStruct = ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
  ['string', 'string', 'uint16', 'bool', 'tuple(string gametype, string gamemode)'],
  ['bojo','torries', 3, false, {gametype: 'RPG', gamemode: 'multiplayer'}]
);
```

## Encoding Arrays

Encoding arrays within attestation data is also very straightforward, lets use the example before, but with arrays:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
string username, string teamname, uint16 points, bool active, ( string[] gametype, string[] gamemode ) preferences
```
{% endcode %}

Which can be thought of as this sort of nested struct:

```solidity
struct Preferences {
    string[] gametype;
    string[] gamemode;
}

struct Profile {
    string username;
    string teamname;
    uint16 points;
    bool active;
    Preferences setup;
}
```

Again, encoding the attestation for this sort of schema using a client side library such as ethers would look like this:

```javascript
const encodedStruct = ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
  ['string', 'string', 'uint16', 'bool', 'tuple(string gametype, string gamemode)'],
  ['bojo','torries', 3, false, {gametype: ['RPG', 'first-person-shooter', 'racing', gamemode: ['multiplayer', 'singleplayer'] }]
);
```
